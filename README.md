# Word Doc MLA Format Python Script

---

### Dependencies:

    pip install python-docx

## Description:

I got tired of editing my font size, the line spacing and whatever I need else to write MLA formatted papers. Since sophomore year it seems like the amount of papers I've had to write has risen. So I automated the creation of a word document for myself. I mean, one purpose of programming is to make our lives easier right?

Why not share it to others, save them some time. Also, why not demonstrate some of my knowledge in python?

## Instructions:

### Reminder:

### Edit the script and change the name variable to your name!

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        name = "John Doe"

The script will prompt you for your professor's name, your course name (Ex. CS-101-XXX) and the title of your paper. (I just copy the scripts and set the variables by myself for each course and professor)

Feel free to omit any input if you don't remember haha, the main goal of this script is to create a word document with an MLA format ready. Plus, it opens the file for you if you want to get started immediately.
